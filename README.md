## Overview

Always wanted a clearer understanding of how algorithms work under the hood? This application gives a high-level overview for users to visualize and compare various algorithms.

## Functionality and MVP

* Users can choose from a selection of sorting algorithms to visualize
* Users can increase/decrease amount of elements to sort
* Users can increase/decrease the sorting time
* Users can Reset/Randomize elements

## Wireframes

## Architecture and Technologies

* JavaScript for algorithm logic
* D3 for graphs
* Browserify to bundle js files

In addition to the entry file, there will be scripts for each algorithm involved in the this project.

## Timeline

Day 1 - Setup all necessary Node modules and getting webpack up and running. Create basic entry file and begin to write the logic for each algorithm.

Day 2 - Finish algorithm logic and implement styling/animation logic. Begin adding functionality for # of elements and speed sliding scales.

Day 3 - Learn D3 and finish adding animations.

Day 4 - Style the frontend,, making it polished and professional.

Day 5 - 

## Bonus
* Add pathfinding algorithms
* Add various animations to sorting
