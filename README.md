## Overview

Always wanted a clearer understanding of how algorithms work under the hood? This application gives a high-level overview for users to visualize and compare various algorithms. 

## Instructions 

Select the type of algorithm from the dropdown menu, set the size of the graph and speed
to visualize. Once all the these are set click sort and watch the algorithm come to life. 
Click Reset to randomize the graph.

## Functionality and MVP

* Users can choose from a selection of sorting algorithms to visualize
* Users can increase/decrease amount of elements to sort
* Users can increase/decrease the sorting time
* Users can Reset/Randomize elements

## Architecture and Technologies

* JavaScript for algorithm logic
* Canvas for graphs and animation
* Browserify to bundle js files

In addition to the entry file, there will be scripts for each algorithm involved in the this project.

## Timeline

Day 1 - Setup all necessary Node modules and getting webpack up and running. Create basic entry file and begin to write the logic for each algorithm.

Day 2 - Finish algorithm logic and implement styling/animation logic. Begin adding functionality for # of elements and speed sliding scales.

Day 3 - Learn Canvas and finish adding animations.

Day 4 - Style the frontend, making it polished and professional.

Day 5 - 

## Bonus/Future
* Add pathfinding algorithms
* Increase amount of displays to visualize
